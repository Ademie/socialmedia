Revamp from my end

According to the figma design and the documentation on it to revamp the design,

I used the same folders and most times same Ui screens as the original project.

I just commented out previous code and added new codes to the project.

The new code can later be modified to suit the project, by using the viewmodels of the original project, this would make refactoring easier and faster.

The project is still in progress.
